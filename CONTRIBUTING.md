This is primarily a fun [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) project, designed to get new developers interested in writing code and contributing to open source projects.

## New Contributor?
Weclcome friend! We would like to welcome anyone, no matter your skill level to contribute to this project. There are some very helpful resources online when it comes to learning how to code in a particular language, Pluralsight or Udemy are great places to get started - but YouTube is a great place to learn for FREE.

### Stack
In your learning efforts you should focus on these areas;
- C# 
- .NET Core
- Javascript
- Angular
- API Development

### What are some good resources to use when learning?
_All of these are free resources on YouTube_
- [C# / Using Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/gfkTfcpWqAY)
- [Javascript](https://youtu.be/W6NZfCO5SIk)
- [Angular 7](https://youtu.be/5wtnKulcquA)


## How do I contribute?
To get credit for Hacktoberfest you must first register on their website (use the link above). Once you have done this there's some specific steps that you need to take.
  - Fork the repo using the fork button on the top right.
  - Find an issue that you'd like to work on, and add yourself as the assignee. This will prevent others from doing the same work as you.
  - Once you have forked the repo, you are free to make changes to complete your assigned task.
  - Once you have made your changes - Open a PR to this repository (more on how to do that [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)) that targets the `dev` branch.
  - Your PR will then be code reviewed, to provide some positive feedback on how to improve or in areas that can be changed to avoid code errors.
  - Your PR may then be approved, and merged in.
  - Celebrate your hard work! :tada:
  
  ### Requirements
  - API
    1. Download the Community edition of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
